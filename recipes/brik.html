    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brik (pronounced ‘brreek’) is a delicious and distinctly Tunisian fried egg pastry that is popular during the holy month of Ramadan. It is usually eaten hot right after breaking a fast. Crispy, savory, yolky… Needless to say, it’s a delicious mess. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack, Spring Roll Pastry Sheets</li>
        <li>6 Eggs</li>
        <li> 1 can, Tuna (preferably packed in olive oil)</li>
        <li> 1 White Potato, soft boiled</li>
        <li> 1 cup, Finely Chopped Onions</li>
        <li> 2 tbsp, Capers</li>
        <li> 1 tbsp, Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li> 1 tsp, Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>4-6 cups, Canola Oil (or any other frying oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the soft boiled potato, extra virgin olive oil, finely chopped onions, salt, black pepper, and harissa paste and mash together with a spoon until well mixed. Allow to rest for about 15 min.</li>
        <li>Pour the frying oil into a pan and turn the heat on. Heat until the oil reaches a temperature of about 370F. Once it achieves that temperature, adjust the heat to somewhere between medium and low (more or less depending on your pan and heating element) and you are ready to fry.</li>
        <li>To make one brik, start by gently peeling off one spring roll sheet and placing it onto a deep plate. Take about 1-2 tbsp of the harissa potato mix and spread it in the center. You want to spread it in the shape of a circle leaving space in the center for the egg.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg in the center, then add a desired amount of tuna, followed by the capers. Finish off with a little black pepper on top.</li>
        <li>Grab one corner of the spring roll sheet and fold it over towards the opposite corner so that it forms a triangle shape; keeping the sides together so that neither the egg or tuna fall out.</li>
        <li>Gently place the folded spring roll sheet into the hot oil and immediately press down the edges with a fork so that they stick together as they fry. After about a minute, flip the brik over on the other side using heat resistant tongs (or a fork and a spoon).</li>
        <li>After about another minute, carefully remove the brik from the oil and place it on a plate layered with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Fry the remaining briks by repeating steps 3-7 for each one.</li>
        <li>Enjoy while it’s still warm, ideally within 15 to 30 minutes of being done!</li>
    </ol>
